## üìå Overview

### ICU Patient Deterioration Prediction

This project predicts patient deterioration in an ICU setting using a stacked ensemble of machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, dataset balancing, scaling, model training, and evaluation.

### 1) Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Datetime Features: The time column is converted to datetime and decomposed into year, month, day, and hour to capture temporal patterns.

Derived Health Features:

Pulse Pressure (PP): Systolic Blood Pressure - Diastolic Blood Pressure

Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Diastolic Blood Pressure + (Pulse Pressure / 3)
These features provide additional insights into cardiovascular health.

Column Cleanup: Irrelevant or sensitive columns like time, CURRENT_TIME, and PATIENT are dropped.

Missing Values: Any missing values are filled using the median of the respective columns.

### 2) Feature Scaling

Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have zero mean and unit variance, which improves model convergence and performance.

### 3) Handling Class Imbalance

ICU datasets often have imbalanced classes (fewer deteriorating events).

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is used to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, balancing the dataset.

### 4) Train-Test Split

The balanced dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, stratifying by the target label to maintain class proportions.

The predictions from these base models are fed into a final Random Forest estimator in the stacking ensemble, allowing the model to learn from the strengths of each base learner.

passthrough=True ensures the original features are also available to the final estimator for improved prediction.
